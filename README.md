# Predicting Stroke ðŸ§ 
## Description
I cleaned and explored a Kaggle stroke [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset) to apply machine learning techniques (random forests and cross validation) to create a model to predict strokes using a patientâ€™s past medical history data.  An [article](https://medium.com/@murray.alyssa/predicting-strokes-addec153c017) was written explaining findings including likelihood of stroke and contributing factors.  **Spoiler alert: this model predicted a stroke with 81% precision and recall.**
